<h2>UNCLE SAM.<br />

<small>BY ALBERT MATTHEWS.</small></h2>


<p>Arising in obscure ways, often originating in derision or
abuse or satire, sometimes repudiated by those to whom
they are applied, at other times adopted in spite of the
ridicule, the origin of nicknames is singularly elusive, and
there are few words or phrases of which it is more difficult
to trace the history. Moreover, nicknames are almost
invariably associated in the popular mind with some person
or place or thing having a similar name; and so a problem
already difficult is made doubly so by the necessity of
attempting to obtain information about very obscure persons.
The history of nicknames usually follows one general course:
those who, at the time of origin, perhaps know the real
explanation, fail to record it, and then, a generation or so
having passed by and the true origin having been forgotten,
a series of guesses is indulged in.</p>

<p>In Yankee, Brother Jonathan, and Uncle Sam, we Americans
have perhaps more than our fair share of national
sobriquets; and we are, so far as I am aware, the only nation
to the government of which a sobriquet has been given in
distinction from the people. For while Uncle Sam has occasionally
been applied to us as a nation, its use is almost wholly
restricted to our government. What has been said above
about the popular tendency to connect nicknames with
persons is well illustrated in all of our national sobriquets.
When the history of Yankee comes to be written, it will
be found necessary to consider a famous pirate who was
the terror of the Spanish Main in the seventeenth century;
a negro who lived in South Carolina in 1725; several members
of a family which was well known in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
during the eighteenth century; the Yankoos,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
an imaginary tribe of Indians invented in 1775 for the
purpose of explaining a word which then first came into
general use in this country; and Yankee as a family name.
The history of Brother Jonathan involves an inquiry into
an alleged English poet of the seventeenth century; a
London coffee-house of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries named Jonathan's; Jonathan Hastings, a tanner
who lived in Cambridge early in the eighteenth century;
Jonathan Carver, the noted traveller; and Jonathan Trumbull,
the distinguished Governor of Connecticut.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> And
in Uncle Sam we are confronted with a similar problem&mdash;this
time an alleged contractor and inspector named Samuel
Wilson, who lived in Troy during the first half of the nineteenth
century. The story connecting Uncle Sam with
Samuel Wilson first appeared in print, so far as is known,
in 1842, and no example of the term earlier than 1840 has
until now ever been cited.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Before considering the Samuel Wilson story, let us see
what the history of the term Uncle Sam has actually been.
For sixty-six years the statement has been repeated that
the nickname arose at the outbreak of the war of 1812,
varied occasionally by the assertion that the term originated
during the Revolutionary War. Both statements are
incorrect, as the term is not known to have been used until
the war of 1812 was half over; but the nickname certainly
did originate during that war.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Moreover, for a year or so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
it was avoided by those who favored the war, and was
employed only by those who opposed the war. Hence the
term was at first apparently used somewhat derisively.
In order to understand how this could have been the case,
it will be necessary to glance at some of the manifestations
of the war.</p>

<p>We are all so familiar with the causes, events, and consequences
of the war of 1812, that it is unnecessary to dwell
upon them here; yet some passages from contemporary
newspapers will perhaps give us a more vivid impression
of the thoughts and feelings engendered by that contest
than will the formal writings of learned historians. An
editorial note headed with the historic words "Era of Good
Feelings," which appeared in the <i>Columbian Centinel</i> of
July 12, 1817, began as follows: "During the late Presidential
Jubilee many persons have met at festive boards, in
pleasant converse, whom party politics had long severed.
We recur with pleasure to all the circumstances which
attended the demonstrations of good feelings" (p. 2-3).
To us of the present day, who take our politics more calmly,
it is not easy to understand the furor and turmoil which
characterized the war of 1812. But if political warfare
nowadays is less abusive and vituperative than it was a
century ago, as is certainly the case, yet also it is distinctly
less picturesque. Is it possible that in the matter of nicknames,
we Americans have lost our inventive capacity?
What has there been in the past decade to match "Father of
his Country," "Old Hickory," "Mill Boy of the Slashes,"
"Old Man Eloquent," "Tippecanoe," "Old Bullion,"
"Rail-splitter," "Plumed Knight," and scores of other
sobriquets that will readily occur to all? It is true that
the nicknames which were so commonly bestowed during
the war of 1812 were chiefly satirical; but on that very
account they are the more valuable for our present purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
In a speech delivered in Congress on January 24, 1812,
David R. Williams said: "Sir, I feel a deadly hate against
Great Britain. Yes, sir, if the red artillery of Heaven were
in my hands, I'd soon drive the fast anchored isle from
her moorings."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Immediately Williams was nicknamed
"Mr. Thunderbolt Williams," "thunder-and-lightning
Williams," "Jupiter Williams," "thunder &amp; lightning David;"
and his words lingered in the popular mind for fourteen
years at least.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> War with England was declared June 18,
1812. In a proclamation dated June 26, Governor Caleb
Strong of Massachusetts spoke of "the nation from which
we are descended, and which for many generations has
been the bulwark of the religion we profess."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> At once
"the bulwark of our religion" and "Bulwark Strong"
became bywords in the war papers.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> In a speech delivered
in Congress on January 5, 1813, Josiah Quincy said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"An armistice was proposed by them. It was refused by us.
It was acceded to by the American general, on the frontiers.
It was rejected by the cabinet.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They renewed hostilities.
They rushed upon Canada. Nothing would satisfy them but
blood. The language of their conduct is that of the giant, in
the legends of infancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>The man who later was commemorated by Lowell in an
essay entitled "A Great Public Character," was, during
the war of 1812, known as "Mr. Fum"<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> or "Orator Fum,"<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
and we read of "the degrading doctrine inculcated by
'<i>fee, fo, fi, fum</i>' federalists."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> John Adams was "Duke

who was made Secretary of War in January, 1813, was
nicknamed "Duke of Newburgh," in allusion to the famous
Newburgh Addresses of 1783.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Jefferson was called "Tall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>

and "Mundungus,"<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and was referred to as "James the
First Emperor of the Virginians and King of the United
States."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Timothy Pickering was "Uncle Tim."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> On
November 10, 1812, General Alexander Smyth issued a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
proclamation,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> whereupon it was said that "during this
time Gen. <i>Proclamation</i> curvetted about."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> General James<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Wilkinson was called "Don" or "Don Jamie," in allusion
to Don Quixote.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>


<p>Besides these nicknames applied to persons, there were
several epithets which were employed to designate a class.
Those who favored the war were called "Wildcats,"<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> "War-dogs,"<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
"War-hirelings,"<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> "War-men,"<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and "War-sharks,"<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
but the favorite term was "War-hawks." Under
the head of "Political Intoxication," the following appeared
in the <i>Columbian Centinel</i> of February 19, 1812 (p. 4-1):</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"OUR <i>War-Hawks</i> when pot valiant grown,</span><br />

</div>

<p>"The noisy and vociferous demagogues and war hawks,"
said the <i>Portland Gazette</i>, "and office hunters in this vicinity,
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. have never once <i>slipt out of their beds of down</i>, or <i>paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>

war."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The "War-hawks" retaliated by calling the peace men
"Tories" and likening them to the Loyalists of the Revolution.
"The <i>war-hawks</i> of that vicinity," said the <i>New
York Evening Post</i> of October 28, 1812, "came to his house
and began abusing him with the usual slang of <i>Federalist</i>,
<i>old Tory</i>, &amp;c." (p. 2-4).</p>

<p>Nowhere was the depth of popular feeling more clearly
shown than in the toasts that were offered at the various
dinners which were so freely partaken of on the Fourth of
July and on other occasions. Such dinners would now seem
somewhat provincial, but they were exceedingly common
late in the eighteenth and early in the nineteenth centuries,
and no doubt they were of service in fostering the spirit
of nationality.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The following toasts were given in 1812. At Philadelphia:
"May the tories of N. England repent&mdash;<i>or be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
damned</i>."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> At Norwich, Vermont: "<i>The TORIES!</i>&mdash;Too
mean to live, too wicked to die&mdash;unworthy of heaven, and
too bad for hell;&mdash;may the Angel of darkness convey them
beyond the bounds of either."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>In 1813 were given the toasts which follow. At Boston:
"May the traitorous designs of <i>junto federalists</i> and their
wicked declaration, that '<i>Britain is the bulwark of our
religion</i>,' become more and more obnoxious by appointing
<span class="smcap">'Fee, Fow, Fum' Orators</span> to promulgate their detestable
principles."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> At Sutton, Massachusetts: "Caleb Strong:
The addresser of Gage,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> the defender of impressment,
the justifier of Indian massacres, the advocate of England,
and the enemy of America.&mdash;May he retire, repent, and
yet be saved."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> At Philadelphia: "Governor Strong:
Eternal infamy and execration to the foul hypocrite who
could be base enough to pronounce the most savage, unprincipled
and blood thirsty nation on the face of the earth the
'bulwark of our religion.' <i>Over the hills and far away.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
At Camp Meigs: "The tories and apologists for the wrongs
done us by the British government where they ought to be,
<i>kissing their monarch's toe. Rogue's March.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> At New
York: "<i>Tories</i>&mdash;old, new&mdash;native and exotic&mdash;marshal's passports&mdash;time&mdash;three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>

<p>In 1814 were given the following toasts. At Belfast,
Maine: "The War-Hawks and Vultures at Washington:&mdash;Having
<i>usurped</i> the place of the towering Eagle, may they
be <i>expelled</i> from the capitol, with their <i>wings clipped</i> and
a label about their necks, to the <i>wilds</i> of <i>Kentucky</i>, the
<i>native haunts</i> of birds of <i>prey</i>."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> At Scituate, Massachusetts:
"<i>The President of the United States</i>&mdash;Respect for the office,
but contempt for the incumbent&mdash;an immediate resignation
his first duty&mdash;the Island of Elba his last retreat."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> At
Hudson, New York: "<i>Massachusetts</i>&mdash;British influence
but poor bait for Codfish&mdash;may she let down her net the
right side of the Ship."<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> At Winchendon, Massachusetts:
"<i>James I. of America.</i>&mdash;In the imitation of his prototype
may he soon be compelled by the voice of the people to
abdicate in favour of a rightful heir.&mdash;<i>3 cheers.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
New York: "<i>Timothy Pickering.</i>&mdash;'A greater liar Parthia
never bred.'"<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>It is clear that every one was in an irritated frame of
mind, the merest trifle being sufficient to arouse bitter
feelings, and even to cause men to come to actual blows.
Duel after duel was fought by those in the upper classes
of society&mdash;whether military, naval, or civil; and even
among respectable people hand to hand fights seem occasionally
to have taken place.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> To add to the general irritation,
several especially unpopular laws were enacted. An act
laying direct and other taxes was approved by President
Madison on July 30, and went into effect on December 25,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
1813.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> In a Worcester paper of December 22, 1813,
appeared the following:</p>


<blockquote>

<p>"<i>The New Army</i>&mdash;The tax-gathering campaign is about
opening, and will undoubtedly be both brilliant and successful,
as the army of assessors and collectors is very numerous and
ably supported by the strong arm of the government.&mdash;This
<i>patriotic</i> band of harpies will unquestionably acquit themselves
with great skill and adroitness in diving to the bottom of the
farmers' pockets and filching away the hard-earnings of many
a tedious day."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Long before this, however, there had been clashes between
United States custom house officers and others. A communication
dated Portland, Massachusetts,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> May 28, 1813,
beginning with the statement that "A most daring infringement
of the laws took place here upon the evening of the
25th," went on to describe the seizure of goods by custom
house officers, who were set upon by smugglers, the latter
making off with the goods.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> In September, 1813, what
is described as "a battle" took place at Granville, New
York, on the borders of Vermont, between United States
custom house officers and officials of New York.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, we get our first glimpse of Uncle
Sam. An article half a column in length, headed "For
the Troy Post," was printed in that paper of September
7, 1813, and began as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'Loss upon loss, and no ill luck stiring [<i>sic</i>] but what
lights upon UNCLE SAM'S shoulders,' exclaim the Government
editors, in every part of the Country. The Albany
<i>Argus</i> of last Tuesday laments the disasters and disappointments
of our Border War, in most pathetic strains &amp;c. &amp;c."</p></blockquote>

<p>In a note is given this explanation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This cant name for our government has got almost as
current as 'John Bull.' The letters U.S. on the government
waggons, &amp;c. are supposed to have given rise to it" (p. 3-3).</p></blockquote>

<p>In the <i>Lansingburgh Gazette</i> of late in September or
possibly October 1, 1813, appeared the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>"Land Privateering.</i>&mdash;The following is a short sketch of
a recent battle, under the act<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> to encourage land-privateering,
between what are called in this part of the country, <i>Uncle
Sam's Men</i> and the <i>Men of New-York</i>:&mdash;On Friday se'nnight,
a quantity of goods were seized pursuant to the act aforesaid,
by a custom house officer at Granville, in Washington county,
under the pretence that they had been smuggled from Canada.
On the Monday succeeding the owner obtained a writ of replevin,
and the sheriff, after meeting with some opposition, succeeded,
in possessing himself of the goods, according to the laws of this
state. <i>Uncle Sam's Men</i>, however, feeling little disposition
to be deprived of their booty in this manner, (for secure as
they thought of the whole, they had <i>plundered</i> but a small
part of the goods,) raised a band of war hawks, and attempted
a rescue. The sherriff called the posse of the neighborhood
to his assistance, and the parties being nearly equal, altho' the
war-hawks were rather the most numerous, a battle royal
ensued. It was long and obstinately contested; but ended
in the complete discomfiture of <i>Uncle Sam's</i> party, who retired
from the conflict, marked with many a broken head and bruised
limb, leaving the <i>Men of New-York</i> in possession of the field
of battle and the goods."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p></blockquote>

the public stores in the absence of the regular army, are taking
'<i>long furloughs</i>,' and volunteering for <i>home</i> by tens and fifties,

without legs, others upon crutches, or supporting each other
from falling, with their heads or arms bandaged, and the blood
still oozing from their half drest wounds&mdash;their meagre, emaciated

a dollar for transportation only. Now it is well known there
are several foundaries in the vicinity of the Lake, and one very
extensive one in Vergennes.&mdash;What then could induce the

<p>In the <i>Columbian Centinel</i> of June 21, 1815, appeared the
following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A District Paymaster of the U.S. residing in N.Y. by the
name of <i>Whittleby</i> has advertised having been robbed of <i>Thirty
Thousand</i> dollars of Uncle Sam's money intended to pay the
militia. It was in his Portmanteau, which <i>some how</i> or
other, and <i>somewhere</i> or other, was cut open, and the money
all rifled! The pay-master having a bad memory, could
not recollect the denominations of bills; and forgot to offer a
reward for the detection of the 'nefarious and daring
wretch'" (p. 2-2).</p></blockquote>


<p>Uncle Sam apparently made his first appearance in
verse in a song called "Siege of Plattsburg, Sung at the
Theatre, in Albany in the character of a Black Sailor.
Tune&mdash;'Boyn Water.'" There are four stanzas, the first
as follows:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Back side Albany stan' lake Champlain,<br />

</div>

<p>At this point, let us pause a moment and review the evidence&mdash;evidence
which thus far has been drawn wholly from
the newspapers. The term Uncle Sam is first found in
September, 1813, or when the war was half over, though
even then it was alleged to have "got almost as current
as 'John Bull.'"<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> While this statement may be true as
regards the neighborhood of Greenbush,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> at which place
the camp was a rendezvous for the soldiers, it is not true
of the country as a whole.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The term first appeared in
papers published in cities or towns either in New York&mdash;as
Troy, Lansingburgh, and Herkimer; or in Vermont&mdash;as
Burlington and Windsor, In short, it arose exactly
where one would expect it to arise&mdash;either in the neighborhood
of Greenbush or along the Canadian frontiers where
the fighting was done. Finally, there is one singular feature
of the evidence. Every instance of Uncle Sam thus far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
given, except that in the "Siege of Plattsburg," is taken
from a peace paper, while not once does the term occur in
a war paper. It is not easy to see why the war papers
should have avoided the term, and the fact that they did
would seem to indicate that it was employed somewhat
derisively by the peace men. Possibly the sobriquet was
regarded as merely lacking in dignity. Or it may be, feeling
running so high, that the mere fact of its being taken up
by one party was sufficient to condemn it in the eyes of the
other. But whatever the reason, the fact is striking, and
is comparable to the avoidance of the word Yankee by the
New Englanders previous to the battle of Lexington. Does
not an absolute boycott point at least to a distaste? It
should also be noted that by "Uncle Sam's men" were
meant, at first, not soldiers but United States custom house
officers.</p>

<p>Thus far, however, the term has been merely a colloquialism,
found only in the newspapers. Let us now follow
its progress in the literary language. Its first appearance
in a book was in a political skit published in 1816, and
written partly in Biblical phrase. Whose identity was
concealed under the pseudonym of Frederick Augustus
Fidfaddy, the alleged author of The Adventures of
Uncle Sam, I do not know. The book itself,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> like James
K. Paulding's Diverting History of John Bull and Brother
Jonathan (published in 1812) and all similar skits, is modelled
on Arbuthnot's Law is a Bottomless Pit&mdash;usually
called the History of John Bull&mdash;published in 1712.
In it we find not merely Uncle Sam, but Sam, Samuel,
Samuelite, Uncle Samuel, and Uncle Samuel's Lady&mdash;meaning
Congress. A few extracts follow:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">What!</span> another history of the war? We cannot be
always reading' exclaims a Smoking Lounger, while he strikes
his silver headed rattan against the door-post of the Bookseller.
Softly, my friend, the work professes to be the Adventures of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
your own dear Uncle, if you are a native American, or of your
<i>Uncle-in-Law</i>, if you are not.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Shall Amadis de Gaul,
Don Quixote and Earl Strongbow, confer unfading glories on
the respective countries which were the theatres of their
exploits; and miser-like, pocket all the renown of romantic
chivalry? Forbid it Uncle Sam, and all his sons!&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In short,
the learned Author, in imitation of high authorities, solicits
the indulgence of the public:&mdash;1. With regard to the appearance
of our common Uncle Sam. Although, he is old enough
to be very whimsical, he is like the Author, a green character
on the stage.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Behold said Thomas,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> how mine Uncle
Samuel hath fought in times past against John Bull and hath
prevailed, nevertheless, he oweth at this time, many talents
of silver.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The place chosen for the second attempt
to innoculate the clownish Snowfieldians<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> with blessings of
Liberty, was Queenston, a pleasant town separated from the
dominions of Sam, by that frith of water which is known by
the name of the St. Lawrence.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now the man Proctor<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
the son of Belial of whom we have spoken had his evil heart
stirred within him again to vex the sons of Samuel. And as
his manner was he assembled again the wicked sons of Cain,
and devised mischief against the small band of Samuelites
which lay at Lower Sandusky.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It becomes us to
notice a remarkable change in Uncle Sam's Lady. She has
lately discarded all her former notions of parsimony and
philosophic whims of economy, and has most graciously bestowed
on herself a very splendid Salary, and whereas, formerly
her family servants received only six dollars <i>per diem</i>, they now
receive fifteen hundred, for each entertainment or levee she
holds, to see company."<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It has already been noted that in books published in
1812 and 1814, Paulding did not employ the term Uncle
Sam.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> But in a work published in 1817 he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This subject reminds me of a queer fellow that went by
the name of <i>Paddy Whack</i>, who came over from a place called
<i>Knockecroghery</i>, as I think and palmed himself upon a good-natured
kinsman of mine, whom we familiarly called <i>Uncle Sam</i>.
Pat, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was grandson, by the mother's side, to the well
known humorist, <i>Paddy from Cork</i>, who wore his coat buttoned
behind to keep his belly warm; and the old man was so pleased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
with his mode of eating buttermilk without any teeth, that he
insisted upon having him christened after his name.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
So he took up the business of patriotism, and fastened himself
upon <i>Uncle Sam</i>, who was a liberal, good-hearted old fellow,
that kept open house to all comers, and received <i>Pat</i> with
kindness and hospitality, because he was poor and an exile."<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The first foreigner to use the term was apparently W. Faux,
who in a book written between 1819 and 1823 frequently
employed it. "Almost all Americans," he quotes a Mr.
Perry as saying, "are boys in everything but vice and folly!
In their eyes <i>Uncle Sam</i> is a right slick, mighty fine, smart,
big man."<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> On November 24, 1821, Hezekiah Niles wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am, however, diverted from the subject I meant to speak
of&mdash;that is, the 'ways and means' to keep the wheels of the
government a-going; a most serious concern, especially to those

several books of travel, not lacking in sharp hits, remarked:</p>

employer, from whom I wished to obtain some information,)
'me,' said the fellow, 'I work for uncle Sam,' in a tone of
unqualified impudence. No matter where you meet those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>

<p>One of Paulding's innumerable skits was "The History
of Uncle Sam and his Boys: a Tale for Politicians,"
originally published in the <i>New York Mirror</i> in 1831. In
this we read:</p>

<blockquote>

John Bull had christened this son of his by the name of Jonathan;
but by and by, when he became a man grown, being a good

that they liked him, for I never knew a respectable nickname
given to a scurvy fellow in my life. Be this as it may, his
family and all his neighbours at last came to call him nothing
else but Uncle Sam; and all his beef, pork, and flour, in fact
everything that belonged to him, was marked with a huge
U. S., six inches long. As I have a great respect for universal
example, I shall give him this name in the sequel of my history,
which I hereby commend to the special attention of all wise
men, more especially the wise men of the east. As to the fools,

<p>In 1835 David Crockett wrote:</p>

<p>"Them that danced should pay the piper; but I suppose
they will all say as the young man said of the old quaker when
the robbers stopped the mail-coach. The old gentleman gave
up his purse; the young man held back: a pistol was presented
at him: 'Oh,' says he, 'don't shoot; old uncle always pays
for me!' So poor old Uncle Sam, I suppose, will pay for all:
and I am glad that the funding system has paid off our national
debt, so that a few hundreds of thousands won't hurt us much
now. General Jackson can pay off the post-office debt as he
said he would the old debt, <i>by borrowing</i>; and then we'll burn
all the books and old extra contracts, and begin <i>dee novo</i>, as

<p>"You may recollect I mentioned in a former letter, a certain
double-barrelled fowling-piece which the commissioner had
brought away from a government agent on the Missouri. It
had kept us company ever since, going among us generally by

<p>In 1835 Edward S. Abdy, an Englishman, observed:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I mention this trifling circumstance, because it illustrates
a striking feature in the national character. 'Uncle Sam'
is the veriest slave of habit in existence, and dislikes trouble.
He would rather put up with an inconvenience than put himself
out of his way."</p></blockquote>

<p>In a note he added:</p>

<blockquote>

that of Caucasia would not be inappropriate."<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In 1838 there appeared in Bentley's Miscellany a series
of articles called Uncle Sam's Peculiarities, from which
the following is extracted:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We must here digress from our immediate subject, for
the purpose of properly introducing one of the most celebrated
characters now <i>talked</i> of. This personage, <i>Major Jack Downing</i>
by name, is in everybody's notice as a great American jester,
but, like <i>Uncle Sam</i>, is <i>but a name</i>. There may originally have
been a Major Jack Downing, a comical 'military' officer, and
there may also have been an Uncle Sam in Boston, whose
initials happening to be the same as the initial letters
of the United States was, from a postmaster, or government
contractor of Massachusetts Bay, converted into the impersonation,
or great federal representative of the twenty-six States,
including Jonathan's own five particular States, New Hampshire,
Connecticut, New England, Massachusetts, and Rhode
Island. But Major Jack and Uncle Sam of Boston (<i>mortal</i>
Sam) both sleep with their forefathers, if they ever had any,
leaving only their names behind; glorious Jack being famous
in <i>story</i>, and Uncle Sam's initials, U. S., being wedded to <i>E.
Pluribus unum</i>, for better or worse, until the twenty-six stars
of North America shall be separated by some violent effort
of nature, or a general convulsion of Yankee Republicanism.
But if <i>Major Jack</i> is never seen <i>in propria persona</i>, he is sometimes
represented by others, who prefer his name to their own.
One of Mister Joseph Miller's jokes is of a fanatic, who gave
thanks for being shown some relicts in a monastery, and added,
'This is the sixteenth head of John the Baptist I have seen in
Italy.' A traveller in the United States is reminded of this
Joe, and of King Dick's 'six Richmonds in the field,' by hearing
of Major Jack Downing of American ubiquity, who is spread
abroad and met with as a resident in most of the large towns
and many of the quiet villages, and is moreover, one of the
most witty correspondents of that many-headed monster,
the Public Press.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The military are for a minute
obstructed by six gaily-painted covered carts filled with merchandise,
which their owners, the 'western merchants,' are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
carrying home; one 'fresh spring-water' locomotive from Long
Island, an 'American ginger champagne' waggon, and a dirty cart
carrying the mail of 'U. S.' (Uncle Sam, or United States)."<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In 1839 Marryat wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I fell in with Major F&mdash;&mdash;, with whom I had been previously
acquainted, who informed me that he was about to send a detachment
of troops from Green Bay to Fort Winnebago, across
the Wisconsin territory. As this afforded me an opportunity
of seeing the country, which seldom occurs, I availed myself
of an offer to join the party. The detachment consisted of
about one hundred recruits, nearly the whole of them Canada
patriots, as they are usually called, who, having failed in taking
the provinces from John Bull, were fain to accept the shilling
from uncle Sam."<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Having thus traced the history of Uncle Sam from its
inception in 1813 down to 1840, previous to which no
example has hitherto been cited, let us now turn our attention
to the origin of the term. Three explanations have
been advanced. Nearly the entire third page of the Boston
<i>Sunday Herald</i> of August 9, 1903, was filled with an article
and illustrations on the "Nova Scotia Home of Uncle Sam.
Origin of his Odd Costume. Sam Slick of Slickville, the
Product of Judge Haliburton's Pen, and his Sayings." The
writer said: "Strange as it may seem, one must go beyond
the borders of the United States to find the birthplace of
'Uncle Sam.'" Then followed a description of Windsor,
where Judge Haliburton was born. The notion is apparently
based wholly on the pseudonym assumed by Judge Haliburton&mdash;"Sam
Slick." This newspaper yarn does not,
of course, deserve serious consideration, and may be dismissed
with the remark that Thomas Chandler Haliburton,
having been born December 17, 1796, was less than sixteen
years old at the outbreak of the war with England, and that
it was not until 1835 that he employed the pseudonym
of "Sam Slick."<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>The most popular explanation of the origin of Uncle
Sam first appeared in print, so far as I have been able to
ascertain, in John Frost's Book of the Navy, published in
1842. It did not originate with Frost, and no doubt he
obtained it from a newspaper. It is as follows:<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<div class='center'>"<i>Origin of 'Uncle Sam.'</i></div>

<p>"Much learning and research have been exercised in tracing
the origin of odd names, and odd sayings, which, taking their
rise in some trifling occurrence or event, easily explained or
well understood for a time, yet, in the course of years, becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
involved in mystery, assume an importance equal at least
to the skill and ingenuity required to explain or trace them to
their origin. 'The Swan with two necks'&mdash;'The Bull and
Mouth'&mdash;'All my eye, Betty Martin,' and many others, are
of this character&mdash;and who knows but, an hundred years hence,
some 'learned commentator' may puzzle his brain to furnish
some ingenious explanation of the origin of the national appellation
placed at the head of this article. To aid him, therefore,
in this research, I will state the facts as they occurred under
my own eye.</p>

<p>"Immediately after the declaration of the last war with
England, Elbert Anderson, of New-York, then a Contractor,
visited Troy, on the Hudson, where was concentrated, and
where he purchased, a large quantity of provisions&mdash;beef,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
pork, &amp;c. The inspectors of these articles at that place were
Messrs. Ebenezer and Samuel Wilson. The latter gentleman
(invariably known as '<i>Uncle Sam</i>') generally superintended
in person a large number of workmen, who, on this occasion,
were employed in overhauling the provisions purchased by
the contractor for the army. The casks were marked E. A.&mdash;U. S.
This work fell to the lot of a facetious fellow in the
employ of the Messrs. Wilson, who, on being asked by some
of his fellow-workmen the meaning of the mark (for the letters
U. S., for United States, were then almost entirely new to them,)
said 'he did not know, unless it meant <i>Elbert Anderson and
Uncle Sam</i>'&mdash;alluding exclusively, then, to the said 'Uncle
Sam' Wilson. The joke took among the workmen, passed
currently; and 'Uncle Sam' himself being present, was occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
rallied by them on the increasing extent of his
possessions.</p>

<p>"Many of these workmen being of a character denominated
'food for powder,' were found shortly after following the
recruiting drum, and pushing toward the frontier lines, for
the double purpose of meeting the enemy, and of eating the
provisions they had lately laboured to put in good order.
Their old jokes of course accompanied them, and, before the
first campaign ended, this identical one first appeared in print&mdash;it
gained favour rapidly, till it penetrated and was recognized
in every part of our country, and will, no doubt, continue so
while the United States remain a nation. It originated precisely
as above stated; and the writer of this article distinctly
recollects remarking, at the time when it first appeared in print,
to a person who was equally aware of its origin, how odd it would
be should this silly joke, originating in the midst of beef, pork,
pickle, mud, salt, and hoop-poles, eventually become a national
cognomen."</p></blockquote>

<p>This story was introduced by Bartlett into his Dictionary
of Americanisms in 1848; was repeated, with variations,
by John F. Watson<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> in 1844 and again in 1846; was given,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>

<p>In the Troy Directory (I, 61) for 1829, the first published,

Ferry Street continued up the hill." Samuel Wilson died
at Troy on July 31, 1854. Of the many notices which
appeared in the Troy papers, the following, signed "Trojan,"
is the most interesting:</p>

<blockquote>

<div class='center'>"<span class="smcap">Death of the late Samuel Wilson.</span></div>

<p>"When an individual passes from us, who has been long
known, and whose business connections have been very extensive,
it is proper that some thing more than a mere passing notice
should be taken of his death, as well as a just allusions [<i>sic</i>]
to some of the principal acts of his life. The subject of this
brief notice was an early pioneer in the settlement of this
place, commencing in 1793, and he took an active part in the
extension of all the business facilities adopted by himself and
his associates, and was himself engaged in, and prosecuted
successfully, at least four distinct kinds of business, employing
about 200 hands constantly, while he took the over-sight of
each particular branch, in connection with his brother Eben.&mdash;He
prosecuted the mercantile business in connection with
slooping; the brick-making business very extensively; the
distillery business; farming, on a pretty large scale, and the
slaughtering business on an extensive plan. During the war
of 1812 he supplied the army very generally, especially at the
north, from his extensive yards. His tact for managing laborers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
was very peculiar; he would always say 'Come boys,' instead
of 'go,' and thereby secured a greater amount of labor than
ordinary men.&mdash;His success in business he mainly attributed
to a strict <i>system</i> in his plans, and the constant habit of <i>early
rising</i>, and to this habit he undoubtedly owed his uniform
good health, and his useful life. He had eight brothers and
two sisters all of whom were tenacious of this habit, and all
but two are now dead, but their ages averaged full 80 years
each. In his political creed he was strictly <i>Republican</i> and
was warmly attached to the Democratic party, and in the
election of General Jackson to the Presidency, he took a very
active part, serving as a <i>standing chairman</i> of the party both
at his first and second election. In his religious creed he was
tolerant to all. He was united to no church, but at the age
of three score years his mind became deeply imbued with
religion, and feeling his responsibility to his Maker, he solemnly
dedicated himself to God and united with the Presbyterian
Church in this city.&mdash;His walk and conversation since the
solemn transition, evinced the sincerity of his profession, and
he has left a pleasing assurance both to the church and his
friends that he now 'Rests from his labors and his works follow
him.'"<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>
<p>Before returning to the story related by Frost, there is
one further piece of evidence to be presented. Under date
of Albany September 17, 1812, was printed in the <i>Albany
Gazette</i> in September and October of that year an advertisement
which was in part as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<div class='center'>"SLAUGHTERING &amp; INSPECTION.</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>WILSON and KINNICUT, take this method to inform
their friends and the public in general, that they have
made considerable improvements in their Slaughter House
in Albany, where they will put up Beef and Pork on as reasonable
terms as any body in the state."<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></div></blockquote>

<p>While I have been unable to identify the members of
this firm of Wilson and Kinnicut, the advertisement is of
interest; and it is certain that there was a Wilson family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
in Albany and that one or more members of it were named
Samuel.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>If we compare the facts as brought out in these extracts
with the story as related by Frost, it must be acknowledged
that in many respects the latter is not inconsistent with
the former. It has been proved that Anderson was a
contractor; that Ebenezer and Samuel Wilson owned a
slaughtering establishment; and that Ebenezer Wilson at
least was an inspector.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> If absolute proof is lacking that
the Wilsons received contracts for the supply of beef, that
Samuel Wilson was an inspector, and that Samuel Wilson
was commonly called "Uncle Sam" Wilson, yet these
statements are so extremely probable that their truth may
well be conceded.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Moreover, the story is plausible and
there is no <i>a priori</i> objection to be raised against it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, certain facts militate strongly against
the story. First, the nickname Uncle Sam, so far from
springing into existence at the outbreak of the war, did
not make its appearance until the war was half over. Secondly,
the absence of any trace of the story until 1842&mdash;or
a generation after the event&mdash;is ominous. Thirdly, a
remarkable feature of the obituary notices of Samuel Wilson
which were written for the Troy newspapers deserves to be
dwelt upon. Not one of them connected Samuel Wilson
with Uncle Sam. It is true that the Uncle Sam story is
found in two Troy papers, but in each case it was copied
from an Albany paper.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> This fact, coupled with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
further fact that no book about Troy contained the story
until 1876, seems to indicate that the popular story is not
native to Troy.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Fourthly, the statement that "the
letters U. S., for United States, were then almost entirely
new," is not only so preposterous as to be beyond belief,
but can be proved to be untrue. As a matter of fact, the
abbreviations U. S. or U. States, as also G. B. or G. Britain,
were common early in the nineteenth century;<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> and it
would no more have been possible for men in 1813 to ask
the meaning of the letters U. S. than would such an inquiry
be possible now. Fifthly, the early evidence, while it may
not be absolutely conclusive, not only fails to corroborate
the Wilson story but strongly points to another conclusion;
while the earliest known example of Uncle Sam is from a
Troy paper, but <i>without</i> reference to Samuel Wilson. Sixthly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the apparent fact that the nickname was at first used somewhat
derisively does not tend to confirm the popular yarn.</p>

<p>Finally, in connection with the Wilson story, we must
consider a stanza in a song said to have been sung about
1789. Much has been written about "the original Yankee
Doodle song." The song thus generally spoken of begins
with the line "Father and I went down to camp." In Act I,
Scene III, of Andrew Barton's "The Disappointment:
Or, The Force of Credulity: A New American Comic
Opera," printed in 1767, the air of Yankee Doodle made its
first known appearance under that name.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> When the
British troops arrived at Boston in 1768 it was stated,
under date of September 29 of that year, that "the Yankey
Doodle Song was the Capital Piece in their Band of Music;"<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
and, much to the annoyance of the good people of Boston,
the British persisted in playing the air at intervals for
another seven years. As the "Father and I" song was
written not earlier than 1775, obviously it could not have
been "the original" Yankee Doodle song. In 1824, J.
Farmer and J. B. Moore, believing that "the burlesque
song .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is passing into oblivion," gave "a copy of the song
as it was printed thirty-five years since, and as it was troll'd
in our Yankee circles of that day."<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> As printed by Farmer
and Moore, the song had eleven stanzas, the tenth being
as follows:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Old uncle Sam. <i>come</i> there to change<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Some pancakes and some onions,</span><br />
For <i>lasses cakes</i>, to carry home<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To give his wife and young ones."</span><br />
</div>

<p>That this version was actually printed in 1789 rests upon
the assertion of Farmer and Moore. This Society owns
a copy of "The Yankey's Return from Camp" which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
probably printed in 1813.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> The Boston Public Library
owns a copy, entitled "The Farmer and his Son's return
from a visit to the Camp,"<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> which I believe to be earlier<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
than the version in the library of this Society. In 1857
it was stated that "the verses commencing 'Father and I
went down to camp,' were written by a gentleman of Connecticut,
a short time after Gen. Washington's last visit
to New England."<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Now this visit was made in 1789,
and, curiously enough, it was in that very year that Royall
Tyler's play of "The Contrast" was acted; and in that play,
published in 1790, the words made their earliest known
appearance in print.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> The stanza quoted above is first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
found in the version of 1824 and is not in either of the three
versions certainly printed in or before 1813. Hence we
cannot, without better evidence, accept the Farmer and
Moore stanza as antedating 1824. Yet it is perfectly
possible that the stanza was written before the war of
1812,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> and if it was, the fact would seem to be all but fatal
to the Wilson story.</p>

<p>The third explanation of the origin of Uncle Sam is that
the sobriquet was merely a jocular extension of the letters
U. S. This explanation, like the Wilson story, rests purely
on assumption. There is nothing in the least either unusual
or remarkable in the process of abbreviating a term and
then expanding it. In the amenities of political warfare
in this country in 1855, it was considered the height of
wit to dub a politician "D. D." and then expand the initials
into something derogatory. In this way John Petitt became
"Dirty Dog," Stephen A. Douglas became "Debauched
Douglas," and David R. Atchison became "Drunken
Davy."<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> During the same period in England, we find
the same manifestation. The London Transport Corps
Regiment, which was formed in 1854 and 1855 for service
in the Crimea, went by the nickname of the "London
Thieving Company." When its name was changed in
1857 to Military Train, it was dubbed "Murdering Thieves,"
"Muck Tumblers," "Muck Train," and "Moke Train,"&mdash;the
third a corruption of the last, said to have been due
to the employment of Spanish mules instead of horses.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
I can well remember how, as a boy, I used to wonder whether
General Grant had actually been christened U. S. and
whether those letters stood for the United States. 'I have
since learned that Grant was called not only "United States"
Grant, but also "Uncle Sam" Grant, "Unconditional
Surrender" Grant, and "United we Stand" Grant.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
During the past decade the South African War has enabled
us to observe these nicknames in the very making. A
London newspaper of January 14, 1900, asserted that "by
a facetious adaptation of initials as Roman numerals [C.I.V.],
the City of London Imperial Volunteers, now on their way
to the front, achieve the title of the 104th, an appellation
likely to commend itself to the regiment."<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Nicknames
have a way of disappearing rapidly, but this particular
one seems to have stuck.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> But it was by no means the
only one in which the C. I. V. rejoiced. Those who opposed
the war invented "Chamberlain's Innocent Victims," while
Tommy Atkins converted the initials into "Can I Venture?"
A more unpleasant nickname was "Covered In Vermin."<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>
The Imperial Yeomanry were collectively called "Innocent
Youths."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>Does the history of the term Uncle Sam, now given for
the first time, tend to support or to overthrow this explanation
of the origin of the sobriquet? While the initials U. S.
were well known in 1812 and 1813, yet no doubt the war
made them still more common. "The letters U. S.,"
explained the <i>Troy Post</i> of September 7, 1813, "on the
government waggons, &amp;c. are supposed to have given rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
to it."<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> On October 1, 1813, a writer spoke of "Uncle
Sam, the now popular explication of the U. S."<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> By
implication it may be inferred that this was the view of
Paulding in 1831,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> of Abdy in 1835,<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> and of an unknown
Englishman in 1838.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> It was stated at the beginning
of this paper that the history of nicknames usually follows
one general course,&mdash;that those who, at the time of origin,
perhaps know the real explanation do not record it, and
that later people begin guessing. Must it not be admitted
that Uncle Sam is an exception to the rule? that those who
first used the sobriquet did record its origin? and that the
explanation they gave is the true explanation?</p>

The Adventures of Uncle Sam, 1816. See p. 40, below. Besides these books,
political skits (written largely in Biblical language) were not uncommon in the

Jonathan, and John Codline (that is, New Englanders) figure in these skits, there
is no allusion to Uncle Sam. It may be added that in his Jonathan Bull and Mary
Bull, written in 1821, Madison makes no mention of Uncle Sam.</p></div>

<p>In the <i>Columbian Centinel</i> of July 22, 1812, "Brutus" asked: "As a friend to liberty
and republicanism, I wish to inquire whether Mr. <i>Armstrong</i> lately made a Brigadier
General in our army by President <i>Madison</i>, is the same man, who has been supposed
to have written the letters to the army in 1783, advising them to retain their arms,
till they had forced the civil authorities to comply with their demands, and compensated
themselves by plundering the innocent and defenceless citizens?" (p. 2-3).
In the <i>New York Herald</i> of January 20, 1813, is the following: "<i>New Secretary at
War.</i>&mdash;Gen. Armstrong's appointment has passed the Senate by a majority of
three. Yesterday we mentioned that a Captain Jones of Philadelphia, was appointed
<i>Secretary of the Navy</i>. So that we have for a Secretary of the Navy a man who
headed a Philadelphia mob, to encourage the administration to pursue the war,
and a Secretary of the Army, a man who exerted his best abilities to induce the
heroes of the revolution to turn their arms against their own country. Nothing
was wanting to compleat the administration but a man for Secretary of the Treasury
who once headed a rebellion, and they have him in Albert Gallatin" (p. 1-2).
William Jones was the new Secretary of the Navy. In the <i>New York Herald</i> of
September 3, 1813, is an extract taken from the <i>Federal Republican</i> (of Washington):
"<i>Appointments-in-petto</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bombastico Inchiquin</span> to be Attorney General,
vice <span class="smcap">Marquis of Whitewash</span>, so long inimical in the cabinet to secretary Mars.&mdash;<i>Note</i>:
this nomination can only be read, at present, by a <i>Rush-light</i>. Brigadier-General
<span class="smcap">Boanerges</span> to be Secretary of War, vice <span class="smcap">Duke of Newburgh</span>, to be removed
under the standing rescript of the Virginia dynasty" (p. 4-2). "Bombastico
Inchiquin" was Charles J. Ingersoll, author of Inchiquin, the Jesuit's Letters (1810);
the "Marquis of Whitewash" was apparently William Pinckney; "Rush-light" is
an allusion to Richard Rush; while the identity of "Brigadier General Boanerges"
escapes me.</p>

<p>Satirical allusions to the "Virginia dynasty" were long common in the Northern
newspapers. In the <i>Columbian Centinel</i> of February 6, 1813, a correspondent said:
"I WAS one of those who predicted in the year 1801, that the <i>Virginia</i> dynasty,
which was at that time coming into power therein ever after to remain, would violate
the Public Faith then pledged to the public creditors" (p. 2-1). See also <i>New York

the recent election by the Legislature, there having been no election by the people,
of Martin Chittenden as Governor of Vermont. By "benevolents" are meant

follows, was printed in the <i>Albany Gazette</i> of December 3, 1812 (p. 3-4):</p>


<div class='poem'>
"And thus I close my <i>message</i> with<br />

</div>

<p>Sir Isaac Brock, to whom Hull had capitulated, was killed at Queenston on October
13, 1812.</p>

<p>The boasting proclamations issued by the American generals were a constant
source of ridicule in the peace papers. In his proclamation of July 12, 1812, General
Hull said: "Had I any doubt of eventual success, I might ask your assistance,
but I do not. I come prepared for any contingency&mdash;I have a force that will look
down all opposition, and that force is but a vanguard of a much greater" (<i>Columbian
Centinel</i>, August 5, 1812, p. 1-4). The <i>Portsmouth Oracle</i> of September 8,
1812, spoke of Hull's proclamation "to look down opposition" in Canada (p. 3-4).
The <i>Connecticut Courant</i> of December 22, 1812, said that Hull "issued a look down
proclamation to the affrighted Canadians" (p. 1-4). The <i>Manlius Times</i>, quoted
in the <i>New England Palladium</i> of October 22, 1813, stated that "The <i>Proclamation
campaign</i> has again commenced upon the Niagara frontiers" (p. 2-1).
In the <i>Salem Gazette</i> of December 3, 1813, appeared the following: "The
same Collectors will be employed next winter to execute the same duties <i>in the
Moon</i>, which, it is expected, will be 'looked down' during the next campaign!"
(p. 3-2).</p>

<p>On August 16, 1812, Hull ignominiously gave up himself, his army, and Detroit,
and incidentally enriched the language with a new verb. The surrender of Burgoyne
at Saratoga, of Lincoln at Charleston, and of Cornwall's at Yorktown, had given
rise to the words "Burgoynade," "to Burgoyne," "Lincolnade," and "Cornwallisade."
The <i>Connecticut Courant</i> of September 22, 1812, said: "Should Gen.
Dearborn enter the territory, he ought, if he means not to be Hull'd, or defeated,
to have 25 or 30,000 men" (p. 3-4). The <i>Military Monitor</i> of October 5, 1812,
quoted the following from the <i>Aurora</i>: "These facts show the absurdity of the idea
of a force of 4,000 men marching to be Hull-ed, in a country where 19,000 of their
countrymen were once before <span class="smcap">Burgoyned</span>" (I, 59). The <i>New Hampshire Gazette</i>
of April 20, 1813, remarked: "From every section of the union, we hear of the march
of troops and active preparations to open the campaign on the northern frontier
with vigor and unless our gallant army is again <i>Hulled</i>, the British flag will soon
disappear from Canada" (p. 3-2). The <i>New York Herald</i> of March 30, 1814, quoted
the following from a Herkimer (New York) paper: "The prevailing opinion now
is, that the campaign will be opened at Niagara; some suppose Detroit. If at the
latter place, with the paltry force now marching in that direction, we shall most
certainly get <i>Hull'd</i>" (p. 3-5).</p></div>

The term was sometimes used attributively. Thus we hear of "the War-Hawk

(<i>Columbian Centinel</i>, September 28, 1814, p. 1-2); and of "our War-Hawk Selectmen"

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_33_33" id="Footnote_33_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_33">[33]</a> In a speech on the admission of the Territory of Orleans, delivered in Congress
on January 14, 1811, Josiah Quincy declared it as his "deliberate opinion that, if
this bill passes, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it will be the duty of some" of the States "to prepare
definitely for a separation&mdash;amicably, if they can; violently, if they must" (Speeches,
1874, p. 196). While this remark has become historic, it is almost invariably misquoted.
In a speech made in Congress on January 8, 1813, Henry Clay, referring
to Quincy, said: "The gentleman can not have forgotten his own sentiments,
uttered even on the floor of this House, 'peaceably if we can, forcibly if we must'"
(Works, 1897, V, 58). It is the Clay version that has become a familiar quotation.</p>
<p>In the <i>Boston Herald</i> of November 23, 1904, appeared the following:</p>
<p>"In a signed article in the Huntsville, Ala., <i>Mercury</i>, R. T. Bentley, a well-known
man, says:</p>
<p>"'It appearing that Theodore Roosevelt, the head and front of the republican
party, which represents the dangerous policies of civilization, protective tariff,
imperialism and social equality, has been elected president of the United States
by a strictly sectional vote, and has established an insurmountable barrier between
the north and south, I feel constrained to express my humble opinion, as a true and
patriotic American citizen of the south, that if the republican party should continue
its dangerous policies for the next 4 yrs. and should triumph in the next national
election, that the 13 states which voted for A. B. Parker should secede from the
union and by force of arms resist an oppression which means the early fall of our
great republic.'"</p>

<p>At the present day such a statement merely excites amusement, as no one takes
it seriously; but in 1812 it was different.</p></div>

who addressed Gage on July 1, 1774 (<i>Boston News-Letter</i>, July 7, 1774, p. 1-1).
Those who addressed Gage on his departure in October, 1775, were of course loyalists;
but the addresses to Gage on his arrival in 1774 were signed by both loyalists
and ardent patriots. Perhaps no one received harder blows from his opponents
in the war of 1812 than Strong. The following toast was given at Bernardston,
Massachusetts: "The governor of Massachusetts. In 1774 the loyal addresser of
Gage, in 1812 and 13 the eulogist and special pleader of the 'bulwark of our religion'"
(<i>Aurora</i>, August 3, 1813, p. 1-3). At Pittsfield, Massachusetts: "Caleb Strong&mdash;The
man, who by cunning concealment and tory prevarication, would endeavor
to reason away the rights of his country, is unworthy of its confidence" (<i>Aurora</i>,
July 22, 1813, p. 1). At Passyunk: "Execration to the hoary head traitorous
vindicator of the barbarities of the monstrous government of England: His treason
is only equal to his cowardice; 'England has done us no essential injury:' <span class="smcap">You
lie you V&mdash;&mdash;</span>" (<i>Aurora</i>, July 12, 1813, p. 2-5).</p>

itself. Between 1898 and his death, President McKinley was sometimes alluded
to as "William I." In the <i>Boston Herald</i> of January 28, 1907, we read of "Kaiser
Theodore," and in the same paper of November 11, 1907, of "Theodore I." Just
as Monroe was alluded to in 1814 as "the heir apparent," so now the same term
is applied to Secretary Taft. See <i>Nation</i>, August 22, 1907, LXXXV, 153; <i>Boston
Herald</i>, November 6, 1907, p. 6-5; <i>Boston Evening Transcript</i>, December 2, 1907;
<i>Boston Herald</i>, March 3, 1908, p. 6-3. Even the word "imperial" is not new to
our politics. In the <i>New York Herald</i> of May 5, 1813, it was satirically said that
"the <i>bewilderification</i> of the enemy, on beholding our imperial standard, baffles all
description" (p. 2-4).</p>

<p>Two examples of the spreadeagleism of the times will prove amusing. The following
toast was given at Waterville, Maine, on July 4, 1815: "<i>The Eagle of the
United States</i>&mdash;'May she extend her wings from the <i>Atlantic</i> to the <i>Pacific</i>; and
fixing her talons on the <i>Isthmus of Darien</i>, stretch with her beak to the <i>Northern
Pole</i>'" (<i>Salem Gazette</i>, July 18, 1815, p. 4-1). Capt. Ross Bird of the United States
Army having been placed under arrest and bereft of his sword, he sent in his resignation,
in part as follows: "In leaving the service, I am not abandoning the cause of
republicanism, but yet hope to brandish the glittering steel in the field, and carve
my way to a name which shall prove my country's neglect; and when this mortal
part shall be closetted in the dust, and the soul shall wing its flight for the regions
above, in passing by the palefaced moon, I shall hang my hat upon brilliant Mars,
and make a report to each superlative star&mdash;and arriving at the portals of Heaven's
high Chancery, shall demand of the attending Angel to be ushered into the presence
of Washington" (<i>New York Herald</i>, November 10, 1813, p. 1-3).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_47_47" id="Footnote_47_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_47">[47]</a> Two may be specified. The following is taken from the <i>New York Herald</i> of
April 10, 1813: "<i>Fracas at Albany.</i>&mdash;By the passengers in the Steam Boat we are
informed, that a fracas took place in Albany last Wednesday [April 7], between
Col. Peter B. Porter and John Lovett, Esq., occasioned by some publications which
have been made relative to the affair between Col. S. Van Rensselaer and Col. Porter.
It is said Col. Porter, after some high words had passed, attacked Mr. Lovett with
a cane, on which Mr. Lovett closed in with him and was like to demolish him, when
some of the by-standers interfered and put an end to the contest" (p. 3-2).</p>

<p>The other case, curiously enough, concerns a man of whom we shall hear later
in connection with the alleged origin of Uncle Sam. In the <i>Albany Gazette</i> of September
20, 1813, appeared this (p. 3-4):</p>

<p>"The following note has been handed to us by Mr. Butler&mdash;We do not intend
to prejudge the cause of dispute by its insertion. The <i>Gazette</i> will be freely open to
Mr. Anderson.</p>

and a <i>Coward</i>.</p>

<div class='sig'>

<p>"18th <i>September</i>, 1813."</p>
<p>Anderson and Butler apparently had a hand to hand scrimmage at Plattsburgh,
for in the <i>Albany Gazette</i> of September 30, 1813, was printed a communication in
part as follows (p. 3-3):</p>

</div>
<p>So far as I have noted, the incident closed with the publication in the <i>Albany

29, stating that the writer of the above letter was "an infamous liar" (p. 3-2).</p></div>

Courant</i> of September 29, 1812, printed an extract dated Pittsfield, September 17:
"<i>Democratic Economy.</i>&mdash;Within a few days past, several waggon loads of <i>Vinegar</i> and
<i>Molasses</i> have passed through this village, on the way from Boston to Greenbush,
near Albany. These articles were purchased at Boston for the use of the troops
at Greenbush. The vinegar cost the government Five Dollars per barrel, in Boston;
and according to the statement of the teamsters, the expence of transportation
would be much more than the first cost. Now we are told, and we believe correctly,
that vinegar can be purchased in Albany at less than four dollars per barrel. And
we presume that molasses can be bought in Albany and New-York, as cheap as in
Boston.&mdash;Why, then, this enormous expence of transportation!&mdash;So goes the people's
money!" (p. 2-5).</p></div>

to explain the meaning of the term. See p. 38, note 66, above. The newspapers
throughout the war literally swarm with allusions to John Bull, Yankee, Yankee
Doodle, and Brother Jonathan. On the other hand, no allusion to Uncle Sam has

England, printed the following: "Curious Terms of Defiance, New-Orleans
April 24. '<i>Half horse half alligator</i>'&mdash;has hitherto been the boast of our up-country
boatmen, when quarreling. The present season however has made a complete
change. A few days ago two of them quarreled in a boat at Natchez, when one of
them jumping ashore declared with a horrid oath that he was a <i>steamboat</i>. His
opponent immediately followed him, swearing he was an <i>earthquake</i> and would shake
him to pieces&mdash;and in fact almost literally executed his threat." The <i>Salem Gazette</i>

appeared in the columns of the <i>Nova Scotian</i> in 1835-1836, and was first published
in book form at Halifax in 1837. In a conversation supposed to have taken place
between Edward Everett and Sam Slick, the latter remarked: "Well, I don't know,
said I, but somehow or another, I guess you'd found preaching the best speculation
in the long run; them are Unitarians pay better than Uncle Sam (we call, said the
Clockmaker, the American public Uncle Sam, as you can the British, John Bull)"

was confined to his bed, asked him to call on his father, as there was a question which
he would like to put to him. When he called, his Lordship said, 'I am convinced
that there is a veritable Sam Slick in the flesh now selling clocks to the Bluenoses.
Am I right?' 'No,' replied the Judge, 'there is no such person. He was a pure
accident. I never intended to describe a Yankee clockmaker or Yankee dialect;
but Sam Slick slipped into my book before I was aware of it, and once there he was
there to stay'" (in Haliburton: a Centenary Chaplet, Toronto, 1897, pp. 25, 26).</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_90_90" id="Footnote_90_90"></a><a href="#FNanchor_90_90">[90]</a> Book of the Navy, pp. 297, 298. The story occurs in the "Naval Anecdotes"
in the Appendix. Some of the stories and songs in this Appendix appear in the
Supplement to <i>Niles' Register</i>, 1816, IX; but the Wilson story is not there.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the extraordinary changes undergone in repetition, I give
the story as it was printed in 1870 by Brewer in his Dictionary of Phrase and Fable:
"Sam. <i>Uncle Sam.</i> The United States government. Mr. Frost tells us that the
inspectors of Elbert Anderson's store on the Hudson were Ebenezer and his uncle
Samuel Wilson, the latter of whom superintended in person the workmen, and went
by the name of 'Uncle Sam.' The stores were marked E.A.&mdash;U.S. (<i>Elbert Anderson</i>,
<i>United States</i>), and one of the employers being asked the meaning, said U. S.
stood for 'Uncle Sam.' The joke took, and in the War of Independence the men
carried it with them, and it became stereotyped" (p. 783).</p>

<p>Brewer goes on to say: "<i>To stand Sam.</i> To be made to pay the reckoning. This
is an Americanism, and arose from the letters U. S. on the knapsacks of the soldiers.
The government of Uncle Sam has to pay or 'stand Sam' for all. (<i>See above.</i>)"
In 1871 De Vere wrote: "In the army, it seems, even this designation [i. e. Uncle
Sam] was deemed too full and formal, and, as early as the year 1827, it became a
familiar saying among soldiers, to <i>stand Sam</i>, whenever drinks or refreshments of
any kind had to be paid for. As they were accustomed to see <i>Uncle Sam</i> pay for
all their wants, to <i>stand Sam</i>, became to their minds equivalent to the ordinary
slang phrase: to stand treat" (p. 251). In 1891 J. Maitland said: "Sam, 'to stand
Sam' (Amer.), to stand treat" (American Slang Dictionary, p. 229). And in 1891
J. M. Dixon wrote: "Sam.&mdash;<i>To stand Sam</i>&mdash;to entertain friends; to pay for refreshments.
U. Sam is a contraction for 'Uncle Sam,' a jocular name for the U. S.
Government. The phrase, therefore, originally means to pay all expenses, as the
Government does" (Dictionary of Idiomatic English Phrases, p. 282). Brewer's
statement, having been adopted by several writers, requires consideration. As
a matter of fact, not only is the phrase "to stand Sam"&mdash;meaning "to be answerable
for," "to become surety for," "to pay the reckoning," or "to pay for the drinks,"&mdash;not
an Americanism, but it has never, so far as I know, even been employed in
this country. The words "Sam" and "Sammy" have been used in various senses
in English dialects for a hundred and thirty years, an instance dated 1777 being recorded
in the English Dialect Dictionary. To the examples of "upon my Sam," an expletive,
quoted in the same work from Frank's Nine Days (1879), p. 12, and Zack's
On Trial (1899), p. 220, may be added another from R. Marsh's Tom Ossington's
Ghost (1900), p. 216. "Sammy," meaning "foolish, silly," was recognized as
early as 1823 in Pierce Egan's edition of Grose's Classical Dictionary; and examples
dated 1837 and 1843 are quoted in Farmer and Henley's Slang and its Analogues
(1903). The expression "to stand Sam" or "to stand Sammy" is recognized in
Halliwell's Dictionary of Archaic and Provincial Words (1847), in Wright's Dictionary
of Obsolete and Provincial English (1857), in Hotten's Dictionary of Modern
Slang, Cant, and Vulgar Words (1859), in Barrère and Leland's Dictionary of Slang,
Jargon &amp; Cant (1890), in Farmer and Henley's Slang and its Analogues (1903), and
in the English Dialect Dictionary. "Landlady," wrote Moncrieff in 1823, "serve
them with a glass of tape, all round; and I'll stand Sammy" (Tom and Jerry, III, 5).
Besides this extract, Farmer and Henley quote others from Ainsworth's Rookwood
(1834), Hindley's Cheap Jack (1876), Black's White Heather (1885), Henley's
Villon's Good-Night (1887), Licensed Victuallers' <i>Gazette</i> (1890), and Milliken's
'Arry Ballads (1890); and to these may be added others from <i>Punch</i>, August 20,
1881, LXXXI, 75, and from W. De Morgan's Joseph Vance (1906), p. 465. Every
known example is from a British author.</p>

<p>During the ascendancy of the Know-Nothing party, however, the word "Sam"
was used in this country for a brief period. "The allusion," wrote Farmer in 1889,
"is to <span class="smcap">Uncle Sam</span>, the national sobriquet, the Know Nothings claiming that in a
nation mostly made up of immigrants, only native-born citizens should possess and
exercise privileges and powers" (Americanisms Old and New, p. 470). "The name,"
said H. F. Reddall in 1892, "contains, of course, an allusion to 'Uncle Sam,' the
personification of the government of the United States" (Fact, Fancy, and Fable,
p. 452). A few examples may be given. In a letter dated Randolph, Pennsylvania,
July 14, 1855, a correspondent said: "I take it for granted that you are with us
heart and hand in the new movement known as 'Know Somethings;' but I believe
quite as readily recognized under the Yankee cognomen, 'Jonathan.' The order
is fully organized in this State, and is progressing finely. All the secret organizations
therefore of this character are blended, and <i>E. Pluribus Unum</i>. The 'Sams'
are going over <i>en masse</i>, and although some of our election returns may be credited
to Sam, yet I assure you that all candidates elect are the workmanship of Jonathan.
Sam is dead! Plucked up by the roots! Buried in cotton!" (<i>Kansas Herald of
Freedom</i>, August 4, 1855, p. 4-3). On February 28, 1856, Congressman Samuel
Carruthers wrote: "I went twice (and but twice), into their [Know-Nothing] councils.
I 'saw Sam.' It took two visits to see him all over. I made them. I saw enough
and determined never to see his face again" (in H. J. Desmond's Know-Nothing
Party, 1905, p. 82). In 1858 Governor Wise of Virginia wrote to a committee of
the Tammany Society: "As to your other motto&mdash;'Civil and Religious Liberty'&mdash;ours
was saved by the Virginia Democracy in 1855. We struck the dark lantern
out of the hands of ineffable Sam, and none now are found so poor as 'hurrah!'
for him" (<i>New York Tribune</i>, January 11, 1858, p. 2-6). In 1905 H. J. Desmond
remarked: "Those inducted into the first degree do not appear to have been informed
as to the name of the order. They were brought into 'the august presence
of Sam.'.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In Illinois the Know-Nothing order split into two factions,
'the Sams' insisting upon an anti-Catholic program and 'the Jonathans' proposing
not to antagonize Catholics who owed no civil allegiance as distinguished from
spiritual allegiance to the Pope. The Jonathans triumphed" (Know-Nothing
Party, pp. 54, 103). Exactly what the Know-Nothings meant by "Sam" is not
apparent from these extracts; but fortunately the question need not further detain us.</p>

<p>One more statement may be considered here. In 1882 A. S. Palmer remarked:
"<span class="smcap">Sambo</span>, the ordinary nickname for a negro, often mistaken as a pet name formed
from <i>Sam, Samuel</i>, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is really borrowed from his Spanish appellation
<i>zambo</i>,.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A connexion was sometimes imagined perhaps with <i>Uncle
Sam</i>, a popular name for the United States" (Folk-Etymology, pp. 338, 339). It
may be doubted whether any one has ever seriously advanced the notion that Sambo
is formed from Sam or Samuel, or that there is a connection between Sambo and
Uncle Sam. "This <i>Negre Sambo</i> comes to me," wrote R. Ligon in 1657, "and seeing
the needle wag, desired to know the reason of its stirring" (True &amp; Exact
History of the Island of Barbados, pp. 49, 50, 54). Before 1700 we read of "Sambo
negro helping caring goods" (New England Historical and Genealogical Register,
XXXIV, 98). In the <i>Boston News-Letter</i> of October 2, 1704, an advertisement
stated that "There is a Negro man taken up .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. calls himself <i>Sambo</i>"
(p. 2-2). In 1716 "Sambo a negro servant" was married to Hagar (New England
Historical and Genealogical Register, XXXVIII, 27). In the <i>Boston Gazette</i> of
July 22, 1765, "a Negro Man named <i>Sambo</i>" was advertised as a runaway (p. 4-3).
In the <i>Massachusetts Spy</i> of February 17, 1813, we read: "The moan of the poor
black man interrupted the sweet song of the mocking bird. We could not distinguish
all the voices that rose from the field, but the ear caught a fragment of
the poor negro's song:&mdash;The lash of the driver forced a scream of anguish that
moment from Sambo, and we heard no more" (p. 4-2).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_91_91" id="Footnote_91_91"></a><a href="#FNanchor_91_91">[91]</a> Watson's version of 1844 is as follows: "While on this subject, it may be as well
to give a passing notice of another national name just growing into common use&mdash;we
mean the term '<i>Uncle Sam</i>,' which first came into use in the time of the last war
with England; but the cause of its origin is still unknown to millions of our people.&mdash;The
name grew out of the letters E. A.&mdash;U. S., marked upon the army provisions,
barrelled up at Troy, for the contractor, Elbert Anderson, and implied the initials
of his name, and U. S. for the United States. In happened that these provisions
were inspected there by Samuel Wilson, usually called, among his hired men, '<i>Uncle
Sam</i>.' One of his workmen, on being asked the meaning of the letters, E. A.&mdash;U.S.,
replied, archly, it meant Elbert Anderson and Uncle Sam&mdash;(Wilson). The joke
went round merrily among the men, some of whom going afterwards to the frontiers,
and there partaking of the very provisions they had assisted to pack and mark,
still adhered to calling it Uncle Sam; and as every thing else of the army appointments
bore also the letters U. S., Uncle Sam became a ready name, first for all that
appertained to the United States, and, finally, for the United States itself&mdash;a <i>cognomen</i>
which is as likely to be perpetuated, as that of John Bull for old England" (Annals
of Philadelphia and Pennsylvania, II, 335).</p>

<p>Watson's version of 1846 differed slightly from the above: "<i>Uncle Sam</i>, is another
national appellation applied to us, by ourselves, and which, as it is growing into
popular use, and was first used at <i>Troy</i>, New York, it may be interesting to explain,
to wit: The name grew out of the letters E. A. U. S. marked upon the army provisions,
barrelled up at Troy, during the last war with England, under the contract
of Elbert Anderson; and implied his name, and U. S. the United States. The
inspector of those provisions, was Samuel Wilson, who was usually called by the
people, <i>Uncle Sam</i>. It so happened that one of the workmen, being asked the meaning
of the initials on the casks, &amp;c., waggishly replied, they meant Elbert Anderson
and <i>Uncle Sam</i>&mdash;Wilson. The joke took; and afterwards, when some of the same
men were on the frontiers, and saw the same kind of provisions arriving to their
use, they would jocosely say, here comes Uncle Sam. From thence it came to pass,
that whenever they saw the initials U. S., on any class of stores, they were equally
called Uncle Sam's; and finally, it came by an easy transition, to be applied to the
United States itself" (Annals and Occurrences of New York City and State, p. 243).</p>

<p>The bibliography of Watson's books on Philadelphia and New York requires a
note. In 1830 he published, in one volume, Annals of Philadelphia, being a Collection
of Memoirs, Anecdotes &amp; Incidents of the City and its Inhabitants from the
Days of the Pilgrim Founders. (Collation: Title, 1 p.; Copyright, 1 p.; Advertisement,
pp. iii, iv; Preface, pp. v-vii; Contents, pp. viii-xii; Annals of
Philadelphia, pp. 1-740; Appendix: containing Olden Time Researches &amp;
Reminiscences, of New York City, pp. 1-78.) In 1832 he published
Historic Tales of Olden Time: concerning the Early Settlement and Advancement
of New York City and State. In 1833 he published Historic Tales
of Olden Time, concerning the Early Settlement and Progress of Philadelphia and
Pennsylvania. In 1844 he published, in two volumes, Annals of Philadelphia and
Pennsylvania, in the Olden Time; being a Collection of Memoirs, Anecdotes, and
Incidents of the City and its Inhabitants, and of the Earliest Settlements of the
inland part of Pennsylvania, from the Days of the Founders. This work was copyrighted
in 1843, though the title page bears the date 1844. In the advertisement,
which is dated July, 1842, Watson says: "The reader will please observe, that this
work having been <i>closed in Manuscript</i>, in 1842, that therefore, all reference to any
given number of years back, respecting things passed or done so many '<i>years ago</i>,'
is to be understood as counting backward <i>from the year</i> 1842" (p. xi). In 1846 he
published Annals and Occurrences of New York City and State, in the Olden Time.
In 1857 he published, in two volumes, Annals of Philadelphia and Pennsylvania,
in the Olden Time. This edition contains some matter not in the 1844 edition.
Finally, in 1877, Willis P. Hazard published, in three volumes, the Annals of Philadelphia
and Pennsylvania, the first two volumes being identical with the 1857 edition
of Watson's work, the third volume an addition by Hazard. The Uncle Sam story
first appeared in the 1844 edition of Annals of Philadelphia and Pennsylvania
(II, 335); and in the 1846 edition of Annals and Occurrences of New York City and
State, in the Olden Time (p. 243), though the two accounts, as seen above, differ
somewhat.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_92_92" id="Footnote_92_92"></a><a href="#FNanchor_92_92">[92]</a> In 1876 Mr. Weise gave the following account: "Among the well known citizens
of Troy in 1812, was Samuel Wilson. Being one of the first settlers, and besides
having a kind and benevolent disposition, he won the esteem and affection of everybody
in the village, and was more generally designated as Uncle Sam than by his
proper name. It is related that on one occasion his youngest son wandered away
from home and was lost. A gentleman found him crying in a strange place, and
asked him whose boy he was, and received for an answer, that he was Uncle Sam's
boy. By this appellation the father was readily recognized and he was returned
to his parents. During the military operations along the northern border in the
war of 1812, Samuel and Ebenezer Wilson were engaged in an extensive slaughtering
business, employing about one hundred men, and were slaughtering weekly more
than one thousand head of cattle. During this year, he and his brother received
a contract from Elbert Anderson, Jr., an army contractor, to supply the troops
stationed at Greenbush with beef, 'packed in full bound barrels of white oak.'
Samuel Wilson was also appointed at this time Inspector of beef for the army, and
was accustomed in this line of duty to mark all the barrels of meat passing his
inspection with the abbreviated title U. S. of the United States. In the army at
the cantonment at Greenbush, there were a number of soldiers who had enlisted
in Troy, and to whom 'Uncle Sam' and his business were well known. The beef
received from Troy, they always alluded to as Uncle Sam's beef, and the other soldiers
without any inquiry began to recognize the letters U. S. as the initial designation
of Uncle Sam. A contractor from the northern lines strengthened this impression
thereafter, when, purchasing a large quantity of beef in Troy, he advertised
that he had received a supply of Uncle Sam's beef of a superior quality.
The name 'Uncle Sam,' a few only knowing its derivation, became in a
little while the recognized familiar designation of the United States, and is
now as well known to the world as is the appellation John Bull" (History of the
City of Troy, p. 91).</p>

<p>Mr. Weise's version of 1891, differing somewhat from the above, is as follows:
"Among the contractors supplying the Army of the North with provisions was
Elbert Anderson, jr., who, on October 1st, advertised in the Troy and Albany newspapers
for proposals for 'two thousand barrels of prime pork and three hundred
barrels of prime beef,' to be delivered to him in the months of January, February,
March, and April, at Waterford, Troy, Albany, and New York. Ebenezer and
Samuel Wilson, who were then extensively engaged in slaughtering cattle in the
village, contracted to furnish him a quantity of beef 'packed in full-bound barrels
of white oak.' From time to time they delivered it at the camp at Greenbush,
where the soldiers from Troy designated it as 'Uncle Sam's,' implying that it was
furnished by Samuel Wilson, whom they and other people of the village were accustomed
to call 'Uncle Sam.' The other recruits, thinking that the term was applied
to the letters U. S., stamped upon the barrels by the government inspector of beef,
began using the appellation 'Uncle Sam' figuratively for the United States, in the
same way that the name 'John Bull' is used to designate the English nation" (Troy's
One Hundred Years, p. 76).</p>

<p>Mr. Weise also gave the story in his City of Troy and its Vicinity (1886),
p. 321.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_93_93" id="Footnote_93_93"></a><a href="#FNanchor_93_93">[93]</a> These of course need not be specified. In the <i>Boston Daily Advertiser</i> of April
12, 1902, was printed an article headed "Origin of the Term Uncle Sam. A Story
that is Vouched for by Rev. G. F. Merriam&mdash;The Original 'Uncle Sam' House."
It is in part as follows: "Sterling, Apr. 11.&mdash;Rev. G. F. Merriam of Mt. Kisco,
N. Y., who is in Sterling as a guest of his son and daughter, told a story of the origin
of the term 'Uncle Sam,' as applied to the United States. He said a farm in
Mason, N. H., belonging to the estate of Mrs. Persis Wilson, who died recently,
and which estate he was engaged in settling, was the birthplace and boyhood home
of Uncle Samuel Wilson, who was the original 'Uncle Sam.' The story, vouched
for by Rev. Mr. Merriam, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is this:&mdash;Samuel Wilson was one of a family
of 12 children, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and he and his younger brother, Edward, located when
they were young men, in Albany, N. Y., and at the time of the war of 1812, became
extensive contractors for government supplies. They were at this time well known
in the vicinity of Albany as 'Uncle Sam' and 'Uncle Ned.' The packages of supplies
when sent away to United States government supply depots, were marked
'U.S.,' and people sometimes questioned what those magic letters stood for. They
were told that as the packages came from Uncle Sam Wilson, they of course meant
'Uncle Sam,' and from this little thing the name spread, until the government itself
was referred to as Uncle Sam. The farm where these men lived as boys, fell into
the hands of another brother, Capt. Thomas Wilson, and then to his son, Deacon
J. B. Wilson, who died several years since, and his widow, Mrs. Persis Wilson, lived
there until her death last winter. Rev. Mr. Merriam was a particular friend of the
family, and as executor is attending to the sale of the property. The house contains
many relics .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and many historic articles, the sale of which, Apr. 30, will
doubtless attract many of the curiosity hunters. The original 'Uncle Sam' house
is standing, although a new house has been erected near by, and everything is to be
sold" (p. 4-6). Edward Wilson was older than either Ebenezer or Samuel. A
letter addressed in 1902 to the Rev. Mr. Merriam brought no reply.</p></div>

the same notice copied from the <i>Albany Argus</i> of July 29, 1825. In his Collections
on the History of Albany, published in 1867, Joel Munsell quoted (II, 479), under
the head of "Beef Packing in Albany," an article taken from <i>Knickerbocker</i> containing
this passage: "In 1830 Albany was not only a great cattle packing centre, but
the same was true of Troy, Waterford, Lansingburgh and Catskill. Uncle Eb. Wilson
was at Catskill; Perry and Judson at Albany: C. P. Ives, Lansingburgh; and Capt.
Turner at Batestown, near Troy." When this passage was written it is impossible
to say, as Munsell does not specify the volume or date of <i>Knickerbocker</i>, a magazine
which began publication in 1833. As, however, the writer specifies the year 1830,
it is certain that his "Uncle Eb. Wilson" was not identical with our Ebenezer
Wilson; but the coincidence in name is worth recording.</p></div>

purchased the lands east of the city, now owned by Messers. VAIL and WARREN,
and occupied by them for farming purposes till about 1820. He then sold them all,
except about four acres, upon which his present residence stands. He has been

<p>It will be observed that in the above notices, written for the Troy papers, there
is no allusion to the Uncle Sam story. In the <i>Albany Evening Journal</i> of August
1, 1854, appeared the following, which I copy from the <i>New York Tribune</i> of August
4: "'Uncle Sam.'&mdash;The death of Samuel Wilson, an aged, worthy and formerly
enterprising citizen of Troy, will remind those who were familiar with incidents of
the War of 1812, of the origin of the popular subriequet [<i>sic</i>] for the 'United States.'
Mr. Wilson, who was an extensive packer, had the contract for supplying the northern
army with beef and pork. He was everywhere known and spoken of as 'Uncle
Sam,' and the 'U.S.' branded on the heads of barrels for the army were at first taken
to be the initials for 'Uncle Sam' Wilson, but finally lost their local significance
and became, throughout the army, the familiar term for 'United States.' The
Wilsons were among the earliest and most active citizens of Troy. 'Uncle Sam,'
who died yesterday, was 84 years old" (p. 3-6).</p>

<p>The same notice was printed in the <i>Troy Daily Budget</i> of August 2, p. 3-3; and in
the <i>Troy Daily Whig</i> of August 3, p. 3-2. In the New England Historical and
Genealogical Register for October, 1854, was printed the following: "<span class="smcap">Wilson</span>, Mr.
Samuel, Troy, N. Y. 31 July, <i>æ.</i> 88. It was from this gentleman that the United
States received the name of <i>Uncle Sam</i>. It came in this way,&mdash;Mr. Wilson had
extensive contracts for supplying the army with pork and beef, in the war of 1812.
He was then familiarly known as <i>Uncle Sam</i> Wilson. His brand upon his barrels
was of course U. S. The transition from United States to <i>Uncle Sam</i> was so easy,
that it was at once made, and the name of the packer of the U. S. provisions was
immediately transferred to the government, and became familiar, not only throughout
the army, but the whole country" (VIII, 377).</p></div>

It is of course possible that the Wilson of the firm of Wilson and Kinnicut of Albany
was Samuel Wilson of Troy, but it would be rash to assert their identity.</p>

<p>The name Kinnicut does not appear in the Albany Directory for 1813, the first

name of Robert S. Kinnicut. A notice, dated December 14, 1815, of the dissolution
by mutual consent of partnership of the firm of R. S. Kinnicut and Zebina Sturtevant
was printed in the <i>Albany Register</i> of June 7, 1816, (p. 1-3). In the Albany Directory

we are informed, is appointed a Colonel in the U.S. army" (<i>Columbian Centinel</i>,

seen, the initials U. S. were perfectly familiar to Americans in 1812 and 1813, yet
no doubt the war with England made them still more common. Attention may
also be called to the example of "U.Sam" quoted on p. 37, above.</p></div>

<p>It is of course possible that my blue print is earlier than 1789, but its date is purely
conjectural.</p>

<p>Dr. Hale writes: "An autograph note of Judge Dawes, of the Harvard class of 1777,
addressed to my father, says that the author of the well-known lines was Edward
Bangs, who graduated with him." It is curious that some (but not all) of the
lines should have first been printed in a play written by a member of the Harvard
class of 1776.</p></div>

<p>By a still further exercise of humor, an article in an English journal on the London
"Bobby" is headed "Robert Again" (Black and White, July 25, 1903, XXVI, 110);
while the London <i>Times</i> converts Tommy Atkins into "Mr. Thomas Atkins." Similarly,
Uncle Sam becomes Uncle Samuel, of which an instance dated 1816 has
already been given. (See p. 41, above.) "Our good Uncle Samuel," wrote General
Randolph B. Marcy in 1872 (Border Reminiscences, p. 66). A letter which appeared
in the <i>Philadelphia Aurora</i> of October 14, 1812, was signed "Johannes Taurus"
(p. 1-1).</p></div>

<p>It need hardly be pointed out that the word "uncle" has long been employed in
this country. In a play written in 1815, David Humphreys made Doolittle, the
Yankee hero, thus soliloquize about the Countess St. Luc, another character in the
play: "I like her tu; though she is so tarnation strange and sad, by what I larnt
jest now. She's quite a decent, clever woman&mdash;ladyship, I shood say; about as
nice and tidy a crittur as ever trod shews'-leather. (<i>Looking at the glass as he passes,
and admiring himself</i>) Well! my fortin's made. I woodn't give that (<i>snapping
his fingers</i>) to call the <i>President</i> and all the <i>Congress 'Uncle!'</i> Why, I am as fine as
a fiddle" (Act I, p. 39). On September 3, 1838, Hawthorne said: "The Revolutionary
pensioners come out into the sunshine to make oath that they are still above ground.
One, whom Mr. S&mdash;&mdash; saluted as 'Uncle John,' went into the bar-room, walking
pretty stoutly by the aid of a long, oaken staff" (American Note-Books, 1883, I,
190). In 1853 Lowell wrote: "'Do you think it will rain?' With the caution of a
veteran <i>auspex</i>, he evaded a direct reply. 'Wahl, they <i>du</i> say it's a sign o' rain
comin', said he. I discovered afterwards that my interlocutor was Uncle Zeb.
Formerly, every New England town had its representative uncle. He was not a
pawnbroker, but some elderly man who, for want of more defined family ties, had
gradually assumed this avuncular relation to the community" (Moosehead Journal,
Prose Works, 1890, I, 16). The <i>Salem, Gazette</i> of June 13, 1815, contained a paragraph
headed, "The Cogitations of Uncle John" (p. 3-2). It has already been
pointed out that Timothy Pickering was nicknamed "Uncle Tim," See p. 26, above.</p></div></div>
